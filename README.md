# Fortnite-External-Aways-Updated

I will be releasing a external source that I will be keep updated, but theres a catch.....

Im tired of seeing pasters buy ud drivers for $20 flex it and then beg everyone for a ud overlay. So many of these kids have gone through nothing and recieved everything. 

I started out pasting og vase and spent 3 days making a shit menu. I didnt know shit and I had to teach myself x and y coordinatates and rbg. It took me longer than you could imagine to get to where I am today. The grind was frustrating but very rewarding seeing my paste evolve. 

I think to fix the problem of spoiled pasters I need to send them back to where I started. 

I have done you guys a favor and added flushfile driver to the source so u can last a extra 5min

This source will be the OG Oracle, it is your job to improve it. My firstsuggestion is to make a new menu design and fix the mouse aim.... (hint hint "void aimbot(int x, int y)" "ClosestPawn")

If you are a devoloper and want to support my plan, you can stop releasing updated sources to github.
